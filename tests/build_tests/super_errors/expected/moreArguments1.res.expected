  This function call is incorrect.
  The function has type:
  (~a: int, ~b: int) => int
  
  - Missing arguments that must be provided: ~b
  - Hint: Did you want to partially apply the function? You can do that by putting `...` just before the closing parens of the function call. Example: [1;33myourFn(~arg1=someVar, ...)[0m
