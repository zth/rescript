  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mxx[0m
  
  You might have meant to pass this as a record, but wrote it as a block.
  Braces with a single identifier counts as a block, not a record with a single (punned) field.
  
  Possible solutions: 
  - Write out the full record with field and value, like: [1;33m{householdId: householdId}[0m
  - Return the expected record from the block
