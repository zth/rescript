  This has type: [1;31moption<int>[0m
  But this optional function argument [1;33m~x[0m is expecting: [1;33mint[0m
  
  You're passing an optional value into an optional function argument.
  Values passed to an optional function argument don't need to be wrapped in an option. You might need to adjust the type of the value supplied.
       
  Possible solutions: 
  - Unwrap the option from the value you're passing in
  - If you really do want to pass the optional value, prepend the value with [1;33m?[0m to show you want to pass the option, like: [1;33m?t[0m
