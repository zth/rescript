  [36m/.../fixtures/for_loop_condition.res[0m:[2m1:15-18[0m

  [1;31m1[0m [2m│[0m for x in 0 to [1;31m"10"[0m {
  2 [2m│[0m   Console.log(x)
  3 [2m│[0m }

  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But a [1;33mfor[0m loop bounds must always be of type: [1;33mint[0m
  
  You can convert [1;33mstring[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mInt.fromString[0m.
